## Agenda for the Anyone can Code workshop

### Day 1
- Create your own GitHub Account and merge your first pull request
- Use this repository as our baseline
- Use Azure Web Apps to host your own application
- Play around with the frontend to customize your App and to understand the basic underlying concept of Azure
- Use Azure Functions to automate your tasks
- Use storages and databases to store images and data

All these Azure Services are used behind the scenes and can be consumed by our application aka personal App.

### Day 2
- Make your existing personal app smart with pre-trained machine learning models. For this we will focus on our managed services like Azure Cognitive Services: Computer Vision API and Speech API.
- Connect your application with the services. This shows the entire lifecycle and brings together best of both worlds.
- Trainers will suggest a long list of online courses to get started and to get a deeper dive into the technologies.

Furthermore, all Anyone Can Code graduates are invited to join our [AI Developer College](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/aidevcollege) or
[Azure Developer College](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays).

This workshop consists of multiple challenges, which you have to complete. Your trainers will guide you through the workshop by giving you introduction talks to each of the topics/challenges you have to complete.

Here's the overview of the training week. Happy hacking!

## Hands on Guide

## Goal of the Anyone can Code Program for women in the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM over Generations

The goal is to show all women of any generation, that anything is possible also in the area of tech and to light the fire for coding. We aim to connect all generations of women whether they are pupils, university students or professionals already performing in jobs. Furthermore, we aim to connect those generations which haven't gotten in touch with tech yet since we noticed that there is a huge gap between these communities. We believe there aren't enough female tech heroes yet.

However, it is possible to dive into tech at any age. Therefore, we thought of starting with something that we are all familiar with - applications on our phones. Together we will build an app on our phones which can take pictures and which we can talk to. And to put it in other (tech) words: _how to build a progressive web app on our phones which uses pre-trained Machine Learning models as restful endpoints_. The application uses so-called REST APIs (don't worry we will explain this term later) and we will use Azure to meet the challenges to get it running.

To close the gap, we will first start with getting the application up and running and then secondly integrate the Machine Learning REST APIs. As a place where we can create our tech dreams we will use GitHub to create our space of collaboration as our motto always is: **Sharing is Caring!**
